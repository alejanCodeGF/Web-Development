## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Most proud:
- Now I followed the "style-guide", and now it's more similar to the original.
- It's better responsive web design than the previous project, with the .svg with width 100% (if the card gets smaller, the photo too. More flexible).
